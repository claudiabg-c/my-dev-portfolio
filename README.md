# My developer portfolio

This a web page for you, to get an idea of my past experience and the projects I've been working on in the past.

This portfolios has been generated with Angular v 13.3.4. 

I chose this specific framework because I was using it in my work place and I wanted to practice it since that was the only way I had to learn more and more about it and apply everything I learned from it on my work projects. 

I also used Sass and Html.

The page is using two languages, spanish and english, and depending on your location the page loads in one language or the other. This was a big challenge to me because I really wanted to approach as many people as I could but I didn't know how to accomplish that location language tracking on my page. But I succeded after all.

## How to view the project

Simply click on the link provided on the "about" section on the top right of the screen and you can enjoy the web in any device you choose.

## I hope you enjoy the ride!
