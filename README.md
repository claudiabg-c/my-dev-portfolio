# 🎨 Welcome to My Developer Portfolio! 🚀

Hey there! You've stumbled upon my developer portfolio, a little corner of the web where you can get a sneak peek into my past experiences and the projects I've been tinkering with lately.

This site was crafted with Angular v13.3.4 – because, well, I was neck-deep in it at work, and what better way to learn than by doing? Plus, I wanted to impress my co-workers (and now, you!).

Of course, I couldn't resist the temptation to sprinkle some Sass and HTML magic for styling. Because plain CSS? That’s just too... vanilla.

## 🌍 Multilingual Magic
You might notice that this page speaks both Spanish and English. Yep, it's bilingual! Depending on your browser's language settings, the site will greet you in the language you’re most comfortable with. Why? Because I’m all about reaching out to as many people as possible, and let’s be honest, impressing them too. 🌐

## 👀 How to Explore My Work
Simply click the link in the "about" section (top right corner – can’t miss it) to dive into the portfolio. And don’t worry, it looks fabulous on any device – be it your trusty PC, tablet, or the phone you probably should’ve upgraded last year.

## 📱 Responsive Design – Because Size Matters
Speaking of devices, this site is designed to be responsive. So whether you're on a widescreen monitor or squinting at your phone during a boring meeting, everything will look just right.

For the curious cats out there, here’s a preview of how the site looks on different devices:
